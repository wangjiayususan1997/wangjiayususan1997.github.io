## About My Project

My project aims to focus on designing and creating interactive interfaces to support workers in their collective bargaining efforts with employers and companies. Additionally, the project seeks to address the challenge of maintaining system integrity by implementing measures to identify and prevent workers from gaming the system or providing false information during bargaining.
