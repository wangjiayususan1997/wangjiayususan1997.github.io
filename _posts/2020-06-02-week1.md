Our team met with each other on June 2nd to discuss our summer project. My teammates and I were assigned tasks on investigating interactive text visualizations, creating visualizations from the Reddit data that help workers to understand problems, reading related research papers on participatory design for gig workers, and learning Figma Design on rapid prototyping.
