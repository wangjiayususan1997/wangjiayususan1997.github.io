After implementing ChatGPT API for our chatbot, I researched and was trying to connect the user's data with ChatGPT. There are two different data pipelines, they either query the user’s own personal data or the LLM (Logic learning machine) model. The LLM will take something from chat history or maybe a new question, and then it will create a new standalone question. And it's going to send this question to either the LLM model or to the vector store, which contains the user’s own personal data. And then it's going to try to combine these together and give the user an answer. With this implementation, users could use ChatGPT to help them search or process saved data from their computer system.
